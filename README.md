# burger

## Overview:

Mmmmmmmmmmm....Buurrggggerrrrrssssss!!!! --Homer Simpson voice--

For this assignment, the reader will find a hamburger logger application that utilizes previously learned concepts including MySQL, Node and Express. Handlebars and a homemade ORM are new concepts that were implemented as well. Handlebars is used to generate the app's HTML, while Node and MySQL is used to query and route data to the burger app.

Please find additional information regarding this project below. Thanks so much!
